Welcome to my JavaScript, CSS, and HTML projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of 32 real-life small projects created from
scratch, ready to be implemented into websites. These projects showcase my skills in front-end development and demonstrate the versatility
and power of vanilla JavaScript.
